        description: `Not a Liverpool fan? Find your team's page here

The fixture list is jam-packed. Ludicrously, Liverpool play five Premier League matches before March.

And this is when the title will be won or lost.

Currently, his first XI is entirely fit - barring Trent Alexander-Arnold, who is touch and go for the Merseyside derby on Wednesday.

This time last year, Jurgen Klopp was battling a mountain of injuries that eventually became unsustainable and led to the season collapsing.

But under Slot, Liverpool are more available and have actually run less than any other side in the division.

And while the squad players let themselves down at Plymouth, Virgil van Dijk, Ryan Gravenberch and Mo Salah stayed on Merseyside and got a much-needed rest.

If Liverpool beat Everton, it will have been the right decision.

        description: `Liverpool's performance against Plymouth was nothing short of abysmal. The senior players who started should have had more than enough to beat the worst team in the Championship, but they were shockingly bad.

But, ultimately, it doesn't really matter. Talk of a quadruple is silly. It has never happened and probably never will.

Liverpool's focus should entirely be on the Premier League, the Champions League and the Carabao Cup final.

If we had beaten Plymouth and progressed, no doubt we would have eventually got harder draws and Arne Slot would have been tempted into picking his best players in FA Cup matches days before more important ones.`,

        description: `Brendan Rodgers wants Bayern Munich to experience “hurt” at Celtic Park after taking pride in his team’s European improvement this season.

Bayern’s visit to Glasgow marks the first time since 2013 that Celtic will play knockout Champions League football, with Rodgers contemplating his most significant scalp yet. Celtic are the heavy underdogs to see off the German giants over two legs but Rodgers has challenged his players to keep the tie competitive before they head to the Allianz Arena next week. Slovan Bratislava, RB Leipzig and Young Boys have already been defeated at Celtic Park this season, with the hosts unbeaten in their past half-dozen home European games.

Jota, Dembele and Muani.

“It’s where I wanted to take the club back to,” Rodgers said. “It’s not just a tick-box exercise for players to come and say they’ve played at Celtic Park. You want them to hurt in this arena as well and you want them to find the challenges of that combination between the supporters and the players on the pitch, making it a really, really difficult night. And we’ve started to do that. Obviously this will be a massive test of that, but that’s what we sign up for.”`,

        description: `Rodgers is not underestimating the challenge against Bayern, describing the club as “football royalty”. Celtic’s cause has, however, been boosted by the availability of Daizen Maeda after Uefa downgraded an original two‑game ban for his red card in the match against Young Boys to a single fixture.

“What is important for us is that we’re very much alive in the tie going over to Germany,” Rodgers said.

“That would be the key message for us. But we want to go and perform. We’re not frightened to lose, that’s not what this is about. This is about going and performing and if we can perform well, like we’ve shown in this competition, especially at home, hopefully we can get what we deserve. Our mindset looking into the game is to win the game to see if we can take an advantage across the next week.”

Rodgers was effusive in his praise of Harry Kane when recalling ­watching the development of the striker as a youngster at Tottenham. Kane’s competitive Spurs first-team debut came against Scottish opposition, in a Europa League qualifier against Hearts in 2011.`,

        description: `Defender Ruben Dias says Manchester City can "still achieve something beautiful" and rescue "the most difficult" season.

Pep Guardiola's side host defending champions Real Madrid in the Champions League play-off first leg on Tuesday (20:00 GMT) after finishing 22nd in the group stage.

Victory over the two legs would see City qualify for the last 16 and a tie against either Atletico Madrid or Bayer Leverkusen.

They have also faltered in their Premier League defence and sit fifth, 15 points behind leaders Liverpool.

"This has been the most difficult season since I have been here but I am a firm believer that even in the most difficult moments, you can still achieve something beautiful," said the Portugal centre-back, who is one of City's vice-captains.

"We know how difficult it will be to get through but we have loads of guns in the dressing room. We just have to use them in the right way."`,

        description: `It’s not impossible for Manchester City to overturn a one goal deficit in The Bernabeu next week but in the context of the season horribilis (by their recent standards) they are experiencing, it feels it is next to impossible to think they will make it through to the Round of 16.

After all, they only just scraped through the League Phase on the final night and the knock on effect of that was this draw - the toughest they could have got, against the holders with the second leg in the Spanish capital.

And it was yet another night when it seemed what can go wrong, will go wrong for them this season. Twice ahead in the match but ending up losing, and conceding two bad goals late on. They are too easy to score against and that is not a good place to be in when they have to face Mbappe, Vinicius, Rodrygo, Bellingham et al again next Wednesday.`,

        description: `Ousmane Dembele continued his remarkable scoring form as Paris St-Germain took control of their all-France Champions League knockout phase play-off with Brest.

In-form Dembele added another two goals to make it 18 in his last 11 appearances in all competitions.

Former Wolves loan signing Vitinha had opened the scoring from the penalty spot in the 21st minute after Pierre Lees-Melou had handled an attempt by Dembele.

Dembele then added the second in the 45th minute with a clinical finish before he made it 3-0, pouncing inside the penalty area in the 66th minute.

PSG, who have never won the Champions League, were heading out of the competition before back-to-back wins over Manchester City and Stuttgart in the league phase secured a play-off spot.

They will be strong favourites to advance from this position and face either Liverpool or Barcelona - Dembele's former club - in the last 16.`,

Carlo Ancelotti was, for him at least, animated at some points as a succession of chances came and went for Real, who posed a threat all night.

When Mbappe drew them level with a scuffed finish, these ruthless campaigners went for City's throat, only for Haaland's penalty to throw them off course with 10 minutes left.

No matter for a team that has been around this block more than any other, scenting City's fatigue and victory, which was duly delivered when Bellingham turned home the winner with seconds left.`,
